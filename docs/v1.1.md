## Release notes
Version **v1.1** now has the following:

*   Support for **AWS Secrets Manager** to fetch the `jwt-signing-key`. <br>
    *Toto API Controller can now be used to deploy Microservices on AWS!* <br>
    Note that the secret, in AWS needs to be stored with key `toto/{environment}/jwt-signing-key`. <br>
    Note that `environment` needs to be provided as an **Environment Variable** in the container. <br>
    Note that the AWS region is, by default `eu-west-1`. At the moment it is **not changeable**.
    The **default Cloud Provider** is still **GCP**, but you can change that when creating your own Config by passing the argument `cloud_provider` to the parent class constructor (`TotoConfig` constructor), like this: 
```
@singleton
class Config(TotoConfig): 
    
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(cloud_provider=CloudProvider.AWS)
        
        self.logger.log("INIT", "Configuration loaded!")
        
```

## Prepare the Environment
Always start by creating a Virtual Environment and activating it: 
```
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```
...and check that the version of Python, after the activation, is the one in venv: `which python`. 

## How to install it
To install the python package, just run: 
```
pip install totoapicontroller
```

Remember to `freeze` the Python requirements at some point, with `pip freeze > requirements.txt`.

## How to use it
If you want to try it out, you can follow these steps: 
 * Create a new python project
 * Create a venv
 * Install `totoapicontroller`
 * Follow the following steps 

### 1. Create a Config class
Before decorating your routes, you need a `Config` class, that follows a few important restrictions:
 * That class **needs to be a `singleton`**. The `@singleton` decorator is provided under the `model` package.
 * That class **needs to extend the base abstract class `TotoConfig`**. As such it will have to implement a `get_api_name()` function that provides a string to identify the API (can be anything, really, it's mostly used for logs)

*An example of a valid `Config` class if the following:*
```
from totoapicontroller.model.TotoConfig import TotoConfig
from totoapicontroller.model.singleton import singleton

@singleton
class Config(TotoConfig): 
    
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        
        self.logger.log("INIT", "Configuration loaded!")
        
    def get_api_name(self) -> str:
        return "test-api"
```

Note that to use **AWS** as a cloud provider, you need to pass the `cloud_provider` argument to `TotoConfig` constructor, like this: 
```
   def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(cloud_provider=CloudProvider.AWS)
```

The **default Cloud Provider is GCP**. If nothing is passed, GCP will be used.

### 2. Decorate your routes
Each route (delegate, API endpoint) can now be decorated with the `@toto_delegate` decorator. <br>
That decorator has **one argument**: the `TotoConfig` concrete class being used (so the `Config` class you created at step 1.)

*This is an example of a decoration of an endpoint:*
```

from flask import Request
from example.Config import Config

from totoapicontroller.TotoDelegateDecorator import toto_delegate
from totoapicontroller.model.UserContext import UserContext
from totoapicontroller.model.ExecutionContext import ExecutionContext

@toto_delegate(config_class=Config)
def test(request: Request, user_context: UserContext, exec_context: ExecutionContext): 
    
    exec_context.logger.log(exec_context.cid, f"It's working!")
    
    return {"ok": True}
```

### 3. Create the Flask routes
This is mostly Flask configuration, nothing Toto-specific here.

*An example of Flask configuration, using decorated routes*: 
```
from flask import Flask, request
from flask_cors import CORS

from example.Test import test

app = Flask(__name__)
CORS(app, origins=["*"])

@app.route('/', methods=['GET'])
def smoke():
    return {"api": "toto-ms-kud", "running": True}

@app.route('/test', methods=['GET'])
def testing(): 
    return test(request)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

### 4. External configurations needed
#### 4.1. Authentication
To provide authentication, Toto provides a service (`toto-ms-auth`) that takes care of the login (supports social login, mostly Google SignIn).<br>
The documentation for that service can be found [here](https://github.com/nicolasances/toto-ms-auth/). 

Bottom line is that Toto generates JWT tokens and the authentication provided by the `toto_delegate` needs to **verify that token**. <br>
To do that, you need to create a secret on **GCP Secret Manager** called `jwt-signing-key`. <br>
That secret is loaded by the `TotoConfig` class upon initialization.

So, in short: 
> Create a secret on GCP called `jwt-signing-key`


### 5. Useful utilities
The following methods and classes are provided by the Toto. 
#### 5.1. Accessing Secrets
The `TotoConfig` class provides a member method called `access_secret_version(secret_id, version_id="latest")`. <br>
This method retrieves a secret's latest version from GCP Secret Manager.

#### 5.2. Logging
Toto provides a class `TotoLogger` to log using some standardized format and info (timestamp, correlation id, etc..). <br>
Note that an instance of this class is provided in the `Execution Context` to the route you have decorated through `toto_delegate`.
